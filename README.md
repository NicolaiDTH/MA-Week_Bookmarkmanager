Bookmark Manager - "Links'n'That"
--
This week we began using Sinatra as a webserver for prospective sites and the like. Our first task was to create a bookmark manager using the Sinatra framework as the basis for it.

This program can store links and has a hidden quiz for bored users.


Instructions:
--
Go to the directory and type 'shotgun myapp.rb' into the terminal. Then visit localhost:9393 in your browser to experience this page!


Lessons Learned:
--
* Sinatra implemented.
* Primative version of an MVC system!
* Testing for html changes with Capybara!
* Basic encryption using BCrypt
* CSS basics.

Problems With The Code:
--
* Views ERB pages too numerous - not DRY enough, was introduced to the layout.erb method soon after!
* Unable to recognise previous users - no database.
